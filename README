PostfixAdmin development moved to GitHub.

You can find the git repo and the issue tracker at
    https://github.com/postfixadmin/postfixadmin/


If you really need the code from this SVN, checkout revision 1899 which is the
last revision before moving to github and svn rm'ing all files.
This is _not recommended_ - the code in SVN is outdated and might contain bugs
or even security issues that were not yet known at the time of writing this.
